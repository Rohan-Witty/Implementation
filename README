Implemented 19 layer Plain and Residual Networks as illustrated in the ResNet paper for the imagenet dataset. 
Trained these networks for the CIFAR 10 dataset to see if it generalises to other datasets
Have included the trained weights in the weights/ directory in .pth format

model - Plain Network; class - Vgg_like
model_res - ResNet; class - ResNet

Training:
Trained the Plain network for 45 epochs using lr 0.1 and wd 0.001  in sgd.
Trained the ResNet first for 25 epochs using sgd with above settings, followed by 20 epochs using adam_w with lr 3e-3, wd 0.1

Modifications to the model:
1) Commented out the softmax because the loss used while training is cross-entropy loss, which when used with softmax was training very slowly. This is because the cross entropy loss itself is a combination of softmax and negative log likelihood loss
2) Realized that had not normalised the images as a part of the preprocessing; but the model should have learned these features while training.

Performnce:
1) Plain network - 11.1 million parameters
Train Error: Accuracy: 88.3%, Avg loss: 0.347580
Test Error: Accuracy: 80.1%, Avg loss: 0.721762 

2) Residual network - 11.3 million parameters
Train Error: Accuracy: 89.4%, Avg loss: 0.309982 
Test Error: Accuracy: 84.9%, Avg loss: 0.482919
